	Hailing from Grand Rapids, MI. Trixy Tang is a 5 piece hard rock band consisting of Klay Fennema on Vocals, Ryan Gramza on Guitar, Rey Hernandez on Guitar, Kevin Turner on Bass, and Dan Premo on Drums. Trixy Tang brings back the looks and sounds from a decade of decadence while doing so in their own unique fashion. Spanning genres from the 70s, 80s, 90s and even modern hits, Trixy Tang plays to all of the listener's favorites while keeping them entertained and on their feet all night long.
	<br><br>
	Trixy Tang not only performs the party favorites from the hay day everyone enjoyed but also performs their own original music with a large influence from the 80s. Trixy Tang is very excited to be releasing new music and plan to have a full EP out by summer 2017. Playing nearly 52 weeks out of the year, Trixy Tang has performed all over the state of Michigan in front of thousands of people including major festivals and venues sharing many stages with National Acts including: Jackyl, Great White, LA Guns, Skid Row, Faster Pussycat, Stryper, Bang Tango, Kip Winger, Dokken, Warrant, etc. 
	<br><br>
	Believing in a true live performance, each member of Trixy Tang was not only carefully chosen for their passion in putting on a high energy, entertaining and professional live show for every fan and every club. Trixy Tang was also brought together to keep the music we all loved alive and kicking and to also continue making new music that is largely influenced from the bands we love and doing so in modern style. 
	<br><br>
	The guys in The Tang are excited for the road ahead, new music, album, touring, playing extensively, sharing stages with bands we love and continuing to chase our dreams.
